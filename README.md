# Active Directory & Windows Server Lab

## Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to deploy and manage a Windows Server Active Directory environment, including domain services, user/group management, Group Policies, and client domain join operations. The goal was to simulate an enterprise IT environment and practice real IT support tasks.

## Objectives
- Build a functional Active Directory Domain Controller  
- Create and manage users, groups, and Organizational Units (OUs)  
- Configure Group Policy Objects (GPOs)  
- Join a Windows client to the domain  
- Perform IT support/administration tasks  
- Troubleshoot authentication and permission issues  

## Lab Environment
- Windows Server 2022 (Domain Controller)  
- Windows 10/11 (Client machine)  
- Hyper-V or VirtualBox  
- Internal virtual network
